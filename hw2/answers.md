0.1 The vertical and horizontal position of a node places the attribute in a two dimensional space for visualization. It is based on a selected attribute or a group of attributes like gdp or population. Datasets with continuous variables that can be positioned in a 2 or 3 dimensional space are well suited to this kind of visualization.

0.2 Besides color, size and position, one can use opacity, relative distances, relationships, strength of relationships, and time as channels for visualization.

0.3 All of the above mentioned attributes are related to each other in most of the cases.


1.1 In equal vertical distances ranking, we can see the order clearly but not the exact ratio of population or gdp between two countries. On the other hand, a linear layout shows this ratio but becomes hard to visualize when the differences in attribute become small.

1.2 Any type of quantitative data with continuous variable is well suited for a scatter plot. Although categorical variables are also used for scatterplots, it is best to use bar graphs with categorical data. 


2.1 D3's pie layout can show data in a 3D format which is not possible with a simple circle. In general, a D3 layout allows for animations and interactivity that other layouts lack. 

3.1
 a. You could change the size of the nodes depending on the volume of the trade between trading countries.
b. You could use color to highlight different kinds of trade by partnering trading countries. 
c. You could have nodes store information about trade flows that opens up on clicking the node. 


Design Studio:

For design studio, I chose to implement the edge bundling design shown at the end of problem 3 with a function to slide the value of years to see how trade linkages have changed between countries across years.
